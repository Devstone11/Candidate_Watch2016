Write-up:

  Candidate Watch is an application that allows the user to monitor the social media activity and news media coverage of the two presumed candidates of the November 2016 presidential election, side-by-side. The side feature, Congress Watch, allows the user to select a state and then it displays all the US Senators and House Representatives from that state, as well as their websites, twitter feeds, and facebook feeds. The goal of the project is to provide a simple, easy-to-use method of quickly seeing what one's representatives and presidential candidates are saying about current events and issues, and comparing them to each other.

  I used basic HTML and CSS to style to project, and Javascript and jQuery to add functionality. I call 3 news APIs, a 50-states API, a Congress API, and the Facebook and Twitter embedded-feed methods to populate the information. I pushed to gitHub to save my progress and I created a new branch when I was working on the Congress Watch part of it.
